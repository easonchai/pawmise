# 🐾 Pawmise – Save with Heart, Grow with Magic

Pawmise is a cozy, mystical savings app where your finances are protected by an emotionally intelligent AI companion — a loyal guardian pet who questions your spending, celebrates your saving, and guides you through a magical journey of financial growth.

As you save, your **Guardian Realm** comes to life: trees bloom, spirits awaken, and celestial elements appear. Spend impulsively, and your realm gently fades. In urgent moments, you can withdraw everything — but at a cost: your realm freezes in time, and your guardian is lost to the graveyard.

> **Save with heart. Spend with purpose. Grow your realm.**
